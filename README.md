# How to run the examples in this chapter

If you want to use the command line, cd to the directory for that example and run the following:
```
mvn verify
```

When running the app, also run:
```
java - jar target/mtgcalc- 0.0.1- SNAPSHOT.jar

# Accessing URLs

In this chapter, most of the URLs are GET operations, which means you can simply paste them into your web browser. For the POST example, you can use your choice of curl or Postman. 

## Curl

Linux and Mac come with curl out of the box. For Windows users, curl is included with git bash (from chapter 3). As an example, the POST command from the book is:


```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @request.json http://localhost:8081/mtg/payment
```


## Postman

Postman is a popular tool for making RESTFul HTTP API calls and useful when you want a UI. 

You can download a free version of Postman from [their website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
